# ScholarGraph  

## Intelligent Research Paper Analysis & Knowledge Graph Visualization System  

---

## 📌 Overview  

ScholarGraph is an NLP-powered research intelligence platform designed to simplify literature review and academic exploration.

With thousands of research papers published daily, researchers face significant challenges in identifying relevant work, extracting key concepts, and understanding relationships between ideas.

ScholarGraph automates this process by:

- Retrieving research papers based on user-defined topics  
- Extracting meaningful concepts using NLP techniques  
- Analyzing relationships using similarity and co-occurrence models  
- Visualizing insights through an interactive knowledge graph  

The platform significantly reduces manual effort and improves research efficiency.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Researchers often spend excessive time:

- Searching for relevant academic papers  
- Manually extracting important concepts  
- Identifying relationships between research ideas  
- Discovering research gaps  

Traditional literature review methods are time-consuming and lack structured visualization of knowledge relationships.

ScholarGraph addresses these challenges through automated paper retrieval, NLP-based analysis, and graph-based visualization.
